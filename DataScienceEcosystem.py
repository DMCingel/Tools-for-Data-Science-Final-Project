# Hello, and welcome! In this notebook, we will be summarizing a variety of tools used in data science as well as the ecosystems they can be used in.

# **Objectives:**
#  -List common data science languages
#  -List common libraries used in data science across languages
#  -List open source data science tools
#  -Execute basic python arithmetic in code cells
#  -Share your created Jupyter Notebook to GitHub

# Many code-based languages can be used in data science to serve a variety of needs and preferences. Some of the most common languages include:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL

# Deeper than the common languages used, there are a variety of libraries specific to each language that data scientists fiind to be of great use, including:
# 1. Pandas in Python
# 2. Numpy in Python
# 3. datasets in R
# 4. base in R

# |Data Science Tools|

# |GitHub            |
# |Jupyter           |
# |R Studio          |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


(3*4)+5
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[5]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
